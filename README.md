# SCORPION-Slide-Coordinator-to-Review-Presentation-Items-Optimally-and-Nonverbally-
This is groupware for users to edit presentation slides without seeing each other face-to-face to make remote editing of presentation slides quicker and less distracting than LINE, given some presumptions. 

Presumptions.pdf shows some of the presumptions users need to be aware of before using SCORPION.

Demo.mp4 shows how SCORPION works. What I am doing on the left-hand side is shown almost immediately on the right-hand side by using Firebase Realtime Database and meta refresh.

**References**

The inspiration is from https://dev.to/icesofty/firebase-x-axios-x-js-let-s-create-a-simple-synchronized-clicks-counter-41co, but its meta refresh and decimal-to-binary conversion functions, as well as its user interface, are my original ideas.
