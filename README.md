# SCORPION-Slide-Coordinator-to-Review-Presentation-Items-Optimally-and-Nonverbally-
My undergraduate research proposes groupware for users to edit presentation slides without seeing each other face-to-face. The objective is to determine if the proposed system is quicker and less distracting than existing means, given certain presumptions. It also determines if it is function-wise satisfactory. 

Presumptions.pdf shows some of the presumptions users need to be aware of before using SCORPION.

Demo.mp4 shows how SCORPION works. What I am doing on the left-hand side is shown almost immediately on the right-hand side by using Firebase Realtime Database and meta refresh.

The inspiration is from https://dev.to/icesofty/firebase-x-axios-x-js-let-s-create-a-simple-synchronized-clicks-counter-41co, but its meta refresh and decimal-to-binary conversion functions, as well as its user interface, are my original ideas.
