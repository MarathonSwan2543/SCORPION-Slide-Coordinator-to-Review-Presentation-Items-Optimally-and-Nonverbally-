# SCORPION-Slide-Coordinator-to-Review-Presentation-Items-Optimally-and-Nonverbally-
My undergraduate research proposes groupware for users to edit presentation slides without seeing each other face-to-face. Our objective is to determine if the proposed system is quicker and less distracting than existing means, given certain presumptions. It also determines if it is function-wise satisfactory. 

Demo.mp4 shows how SCORPION works. What I am doing on the left-hand side is shown almost immediately on the right-hand side by using Firebase Realtime Database.
