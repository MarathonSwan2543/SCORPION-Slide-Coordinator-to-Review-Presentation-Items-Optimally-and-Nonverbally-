# SCORPION-Slide-Coordinator-to-Review-Presentation-Items-Optimally-and-Nonverbally-
This is groupware to make the remote editing of presentation slides quicker and less distracting than LINE when given a set of presumptions. 

Presumptions.pdf shows some of the presumptions users need to be aware of before using SCORPION.

Demo.mp4 shows how SCORPION works. What I am doing on the left-hand side is shown almost immediately on the right-hand side by using Firebase Realtime Database and meta refresh.

The inspiration is from https://dev.to/icesofty/firebase-x-axios-x-js-let-s-create-a-simple-synchronized-clicks-counter-41co, but its meta refresh and decimal-to-binary conversion functions, as well as its user interface, are my original ideas.
